**Digit Recognition using Neural Networks**
"code.ipynb"
This project demonstrates digit recognition using a neural network implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

**Project Overview:**
The project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
Model Training: Define and train a neural network model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.
Prediction on Custom Image: Upload and preprocess a custom handwritten digit image, and predict its label using the trained model.

**MNIST Digit Recognizer with CNN**
"digit_recognizer_cnn.ipynb"
This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Additionally, it includes functionality to predict digits from user-uploaded images in Google Colab.
*Usage*
Train the Model:
-Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
-Define and compile the CNN model.
-Train the model with the training data.
-Evaluate the model on test data.

Predict Digit from Image:
-Run the script in Google Colab.
-Use the files.upload() function to upload an image of a digit.
-The model will preprocess the image and display the predicted digit.
