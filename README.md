**Digit Recognition using Neural Networks**
This project demonstrates digit recognition using a neural network implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

**Project Overview:**
The project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
Model Training: Define and train a neural network model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.
Prediction on Custom Image: Upload and preprocess a custom handwritten digit image, and predict its label using the trained model.

The MNIST dataset is publicly available and can be accessed from Yann LeCun's website.
